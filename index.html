  <h2>How Loan Eligibility is Calculated</h2>

  <p>
    Loan eligibility is usually calculated as a percentage of your monthly income.
    Most banks allow 30% to 50% of your income to be used as EMI.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      Eligible EMI = Monthly Income × Eligibility Percentage
    </strong>

  <h2>Example of Loan Eligibility Calculation</h2>

    If your monthly income is ₹50,000 and the EMI affordability is 40%,
    then your eligible EMI will be:
